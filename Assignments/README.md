# Note
There are 3 assignments in this folder with assignments 1 & 2 being notebooks and assignment 3 being another folder. The reason is because the task involved creating
a particle detector in Geant4 and then analysing the results of the experiment in Python; thus, it contains both code to produce the detector and the data analysis code.
