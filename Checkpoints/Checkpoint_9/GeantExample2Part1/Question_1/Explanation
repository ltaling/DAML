Looking at the histograms of both the neutrons and electrons (20 each, fired with 100 MeV energy), we see that the electrons deposit most of their energy in the earlier layers whilst neutrons deposit them in the deeper layers. Furthermore, neutrons deposit no more than 100 MeV in any layer meaning the majority pass through without interacting much. Conversely, electrons deposit around 800 MeV in the first layer meaning they interact more readily than neutrons. This is due to the fact that electrons are charged leptons whilst neutrons are uncharged hadrons, meaning that electrons undergo showering via the EM interaction which has a much longer range than hadronic showers.
