# Note
A collection of the checkpoints submitted for the course. The earlier checkpoints have the instructions written in the notebooks but later on,
there is just code without the original assignment instructions. It should, however, not matter as the task can be decifered from the comments and the code itself.
The majority of these are .ipynb files but there is one folder as they contain C++ code, since GEANT4 was used to create the datasets.
