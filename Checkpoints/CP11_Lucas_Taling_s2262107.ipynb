    "The mass of this particle lies very close to the mass of the Z boson, given by the PDG value of 91.1876 GeV. The partial decay width, $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\mu}$, of this particle is significantly greater than the one given by the PDG value (0.09 GeV) but that is likely due to the approximations we made in our data analysis giving us a wider peak. On top of this, the Z-boson decay $Z\\rightarrow\\mu^++\\mu^-$ is an allowed decay so the result makes perfect sense."
